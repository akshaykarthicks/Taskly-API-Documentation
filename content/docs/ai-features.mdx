## How AI Subtask Generation Works

### The Process

<Steps>

<Step>

### Describe Your Task

Simply enter a task title and description. The more detailed your description, the better the AI can understand your project scope.

**Example Input:**
```
Title: Build crew AI project for food crew
Description: I need to build crew AI project for food crew so give me step process with timing to complete within 10 days
```

</Step>

<Step>

### AI Analysis

When you click "Generate Subtasks", our AI:
1. **Analyzes** your task description
2. **Identifies** key project phases
3. **Estimates** realistic timelines
4. **Breaks down** complex requirements
5. **Generates** actionable subtasks

</Step>

<Step>

### Review Generated Subtasks

The AI provides a structured breakdown with:
- Clear subtask descriptions
- Time estimates (Day 1-2, Day 2-3, etc.)
- Logical sequence of steps
- Realistic completion timelines

**Example Output:**
- Define AI functionalities and scope (Day 1-2)
- Data acquisition and preprocessing (Day 2-3)
- AI model selection and training (Day 3-6)
- Develop user interface and integration (Day 6-9)
- Testing and refinement (Day 9-10)
- Deployment and documentation (Day 10)

</Step>

<Step>

### Customize & Execute

Review the AI-generated subtasks and:
- Edit any subtask as needed
- Adjust timelines based on your schedule
- Add or remove subtasks
- Start executing your plan

</Step>

</Steps>

## AI API Integration

Developers can integrate AI subtask generation into their applications:

### Generate Subtasks via API

<Tabs items={['Request', 'Response']}>

<Tab value="Request">

```http
POST /api/tasks/{task_id}/generate-subtasks
Authorization: Token {your_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "task_id": 5,
  "context": {
    "timeline": "10 days",
    "team_size": 2,
    "complexity": "medium"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="Response">

```json
{
  "task_id": 5,
  "subtasks": [
    {
      "title": "Define AI functionalities and scope",
      "timeline": "Day 1-2",
      "order": 1,
      "estimated_hours": 16
    },
    {
      "title": "Data acquisition and preprocessing",
      "timeline": "Day 2-3",
      "order": 2,
      "estimated_hours": 8
    },
    {
      "title": "AI model selection and training",
      "timeline": "Day 3-6",
      "order": 3,
      "estimated_hours": 24
    }
  ],
  "total_estimated_hours": 80,
  "confidence_score": 0.92
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
async function generateSubtasks(taskId, taskDescription) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/tasks/${taskId}/generate-subtasks`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Token ${authToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      task_id: taskId,
      description: taskDescription,
      context: {
        timeline: '2 weeks',
        team_size: 3
      }
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.subtasks;
}
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

def generate_subtasks(task_id, description, timeline="2 weeks"):
    url = f"http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/{task_id}/generate-subtasks"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Token {auth_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "task_id": task_id,
        "description": description,
        "context": {
            "timeline": timeline,
            "team_size": 2
        }
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response.json()["subtasks"]
