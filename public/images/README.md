# Images for Documentation

Place your screenshot images in this folder and reference them in the MDX files.

## How to Add Images

1. Save your screenshots in this folder with descriptive names:
   - `dashboard.png` - Main dashboard view
   - `create-task.png` - Create task modal
   - `task-detail.png` - Task detail with subtasks
   - `landing.png` - Landing page

2. Reference them in your MDX files using:
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](/images/your-image.png)
   ```

## Current Images Needed

Based on the documentation, add these screenshots:
- `dashboard.png` - The main dashboard with analytics
- `create-task.png` - The "Create New Task" modal
- `task-detail.png` - Task detail view showing AI-generated subtasks
- `landing.png` - Landing page (optional)

## Image Guidelines

- Use PNG format for screenshots
- Recommended width: 1200-1600px
- Keep file sizes reasonable (compress if needed)
- Use descriptive filenames
- Dark mode screenshots preferred to match the theme
